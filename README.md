# MgShell Capstone Project 
## Augmented Arduino Code for pH reading 


Within the scope of the **Capstone Projects (PoliMi, 2023, professor Jacchetti)**. We were asked by MgShell to include a pH sensor in the current incubator setup, we are adding a pH microprobe by Atlas Scientific, and reading it through Arduino. Our code simply adds the reading of this latter sensor to the LCD display

This folder contains an edited code by L. Bontempi, G. Noya, G. De Franceschi, M.Marras C. Russo and A. Sparapani. The original code was provided by MgShell.

In this folder you will find
1. [Code](/MgShell_Capstone_2023/arduino_UNO_pH_sample_code/arduino_UNO_pH_sample_code.ino) to deal wih the pH sensor provided by Atlas Scientfic 
2. [Edited code](/MgShell_Capstone_2023/codiceincubatoriLTMP/codiceincubatoriLTMP.ino) for Arduino control of the MgShell's setup

They are both written in .ino format and can be built on an ArduinoUNO or MEGA.
